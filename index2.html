    <h2>Disadvantages  <span style="color: blue;">[edit]</span></h2>
    <p>Compared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:</p>
    <h4>Performance   <span style="color: blue;">[edit]</span></h4>
    <p>The majority of laptops released in 2022 are capable of common tasks such as web browsing, video playback, and office applications, enev at the low end. That said, performance f desktops often surpass comparably priced laptops. 
The upper limits of performance of laptops remain lower than desktops, due to mostly practical reasons, such as decreased battery life, increased size and heat, etc.        
    </p>
    <h4> Upgradeability <span style="color: blue;">[edit]</span></h4>
    <p>The upgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to thoroughly standardized desktops, due to technical and economic reasons. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily.Due to the integrated nature of laptops, however,motherboard, CPU, and graphics, are seldom officially upgradeable.Some efforts towards industry standard parts and layouts have been attempted, such as <span style="color: blue;">Common Building Block</span>, but the industry remains largely <span style="color: blue;">proprietary</span> and fragmented . There is no industry-wide standard <span style="color: blue;">form factor</span>for laptops; Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components(CPU,SSD,RAM,etc)  to reduce size and upgradeability prospects <sup><span style="color: blue;">[40]</span></sup></p>

    <h4> Ergonomics and health effects <span style="color: blue;">[edit]</span></h4>
    
    <h4> Wrists <span style="color: blue;">[edit]</span></h4>
    <p>Prolonged use of laptops  can cause <span style="color: blue;">repetitive strain injury</span> because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices. <sup><span style="color: blue;">[61]</span></sup> Usage of separate,external <span style="color: blue;">ergonomic keyboards</span> and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working  for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB, <span style="color: blue;">Bluetooth</span> or via a docking station.Some health standards require egonomic keyboards at workplaces.  </p>
    <h4> Neck and spine<span style="color: blue;">[edit]</span></h4>
    <p>A laptop's integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries . A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a <span style="color: blue;">computer stand</span> </p>
